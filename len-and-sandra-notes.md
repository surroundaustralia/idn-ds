## Some thoughts on sustainability and core tasks

See these very rough notes https://rdxx.org/idn/sustainability.txt 
Would be good to go through this quickly with Nick to extract various requirements (and/or add this doc as a source?).

## thoughts on sources

### Comments on the AI/Indigenous paper added by Sam:

 - opens way to having MR (machine readable) "permissions" to assist elders determining access
 - Table 2 expresses access protection requirements succinctly
 - 2nd order cybernetics (i.e. including observer as part of observing systems) an important insight
 - suggest emphasis in our work is less about representing indigenous ontologies (a long term project) but is more about adapting "at hand" tools, aiming to:
   -- raise indigenous data capabilities by offering a practical, working data repository and catalog; 
   -- offer working examples (case studies) of what is possible for critique and feedback by partners and network members;
   -- enable others to replicate and re-apply case studies in different contexts
