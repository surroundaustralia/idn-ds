## Source Items

### 1. Paper: Out of the Black Box: Indigenous protocols for AI

* [Out of the Black Box: Indigenous protocols for AI](Abdilla2021-Final+Unesco+Paper_Designed.pdf)

### 2. Research article: The role of political ontology for Indigenous self-determination

* [External article by Mattias Kramm 26 Oct 2021:https://doi.org/10.1080/13698230.2021.1997250](https://doi.org/10.1080/13698230.2021.1997250) added 2022-02-15 by ss.

Comment: I was thinking about the kinds of things represented in the ATNS database ([new site https://www.atns.net.au/](https://www.atns.net.au/) and [old website data lodgement](https://database.atns.net.au/lodge.asp) ). While doing so I encountered this article. Whilst "ontology" in the article is used in a philosophical context I see no reason why we can't be striving to make explicit and transparent the tensions between multiple ways of seeing. I suspect there is a common trope in our work of having to not so much "harmonise" between two different ways of seeing, but to facilitate "communication" (thinking of Luhmann here) such as the "federal" conceptions Kramm suggests. The article evokes the kinds of strategies and approaches we could consider adopting in the cataloging and ontology development process (i.e. the goal of making explicit relationships between different things and different descriptions of those things). 

### 3. Research article (Aaron Corn):

  * [External article by Aaron Corn "Exploring the applicability of the Semantic Web for discovering and navigating Australian Indigenous knowledge resources"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01576895.2019.1575248)

Interesting paper describing the application of semantic web and OWL to represneting indigenous ontologies of relatedness. [Aaron](https://indigenousknowledge.unimelb.edu.au/about/governance/professor-aaron-corn) is a collaborator on the project who works at the University of Melbourne IKI (Indigenous Knowledge Institute).

### 4. Sources for Indigenous Controlled Research Organisations

 * early IDN work ARDC funded from 2019, useful contextual background: [https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TD36-Final-report.pdf](https://ardc.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/TD36-Final-report.pdf) (Note: no longer on IDN website -- it's status may need reindorsement by IDN Steering Committee?).

### 5. CARE principles in practice in Australian context

  * from CSIRO: [Caring for Indigenous Data to Evaluate the Benefits of Indigenous Environmental Programs, 2021](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00267-021-01485-8.pdf). A useful source for ontology development work.

### 6. CARE principles in an International Context

  * useful comparative overview: [CARE principles for Indigenous Data Governance](http://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2020-043) particularly Fig 2 (useful starting point for vocabularisation). Also worth reading the [Smithsonian Institute's 2019 policy implementation](https://www.si.edu/content/pdf/about/sd/SD609.pdf) referenced in the paper.

### 7. FAIR Data Maturity model

  * [RDA's detailed work on FAIR](https://www.rd-alliance.org/system/files/FAIR%20Data%20Maturity%20Model_%20specification%20and%20guidelines_v0.90.pdf) (via Nic 16th April).

### 8. Indigenous Studies - Research Data Management Policy

  * [Ingrid Mason's Presentation 20 2014 National Indigenous Studies Conference on RDM Policy](https://aiatsis.gov.au/publication/117065) (one wonders what if anything has changed in the last 8 years?). 
 
 Slide 49 Data Management checklist (KISS):
 * Policy: principles
 * Storage: secure and robust
 * Metadata: discover and access (FAIR:"F" and "A")
 * Licensing: reuse (FAIR:"R")
 * Ethics: consent (CARE:"A" and "R" and "E")??
 * Identifiers: stable -- is the DOI/PID about the landing page, or about the dataset(s)???
 
 Slide 60: Take away: Formalise info about data custodianship and support of indig. research:
 * How decisions are made to collect or use data and support of indig. reserachrch
 * What expert and relevant advice informs those decisons and how that advice is sought
 * What prior decisons have been made and why
 * What policies and processes (informational and technical access) are in place and why
