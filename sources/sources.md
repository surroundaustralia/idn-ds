Comment: I was thinking about the kinds of things represented in the ATNS database ([new site https://www.atns.net.au/](https://www.atns.net.au/) and [old website data lodgement](https://database.atns.net.au/lodge.asp) ). While doing so I encountered this article. Whilst "ontology" in the article is used in a philosophical context I see no reason why we can't be striving to make explicit and transparent the tensions between multiple ways of seeing. I suspect there is a common trope in our work of having to not so much "harmonise" between two different ways of seeing, but to facilitate "communication" (thinking of Luhmann here) such as the "federal" conceptions Kramm suggests. The article evokes the kinds of strategies and approaches we could consider adopting in the cataloging and ontology development process (i.e. the goal of making explicit relationships between different things and different descriptions of those things). 

### 3, Research article (Aaron Corn):

  * [External article by Aaron Corn "Exploring the applicability of the Semantic Web for discovering and navigating Australian Indigenous knowledge resources"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01576895.2019.1575248)

Interesting paper describing the application of semantic web and OWL to represneting indigenous ontologies of relatedness.
